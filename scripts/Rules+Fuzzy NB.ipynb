This can be attempted to be resolved through word embeddings that give us vector representations of the similarity between medical concepts.\n","\n","- Can use n-gram representations with the same rule to pick up on other similarities that exist. Often times,even after removing a word, just having one word in common is not restrictive enough to identify true positives. \n","\n","- Related to the first point, often times we are missing cases
